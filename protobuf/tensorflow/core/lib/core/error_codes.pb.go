	// errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information
	// may be converted to this error.
	UNKNOWN Code = 2
	// Client specified an invalid argument.  Note that this differs

	INVALID_ARGUMENT Code = 3
	// Deadline expired before operation could complete.  For operations
	// that change the state of the system, this error may be returned

	// successful response from a server could have been delayed long
	// enough for the deadline to expire.

	// does not have the access right to the entity.

	// already exists.
	ALREADY_EXISTS Code = 6
	// The caller does not have permission to execute the specified
	// operation.  PERMISSION_DENIED must not be used for rejections
	// caused by exhausting some resource (use RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
	// instead for those errors).  PERMISSION_DENIED must not be
	// used if the caller can not be identified (use UNAUTHENTICATED
	// instead for those errors).
	PERMISSION_DENIED Code = 7
	// The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the
	// operation.
	UNAUTHENTICATED Code = 16

	// perhaps the entire file system is out of space.
	RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED Code = 8
	// Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state

	// A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding
	// between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE:
	//  (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call.
	//  (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher-level
	//      (e.g., restarting a read-modify-write sequence).
	//  (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until
	//      the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
	//      fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION
	//      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
	//      they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
	//  (d) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
	//      REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
	//      server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
	//      read-modify-write on the same resource.
	FAILED_PRECONDITION Code = 9
	// The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue
	// like sequencer check failures, transaction aborts, etc.

	// ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE.
	ABORTED Code = 10
	// Operation tried to iterate past the valid input range.  E.g., seeking or
	// reading past end of file.
	//
	// Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may
	// be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
	// system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an
	// offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
	// OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current
	// file size.
	//
	// There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and
	// OUT_OF_RANGE.  We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific
	// error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
	// a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when
	// they are done.
	OUT_OF_RANGE Code = 11
	// Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled in this service.
	UNIMPLEMENTED Code = 12
	// Internal errors.  Means some invariants expected by underlying
	// system has been broken.  If you see one of these errors,
	// something is very broken.
	INTERNAL Code = 13
	// The service is currently unavailable.  This is a most likely a
	// transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with
